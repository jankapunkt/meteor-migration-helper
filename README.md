Detect which parts of your Meteor.js server environment need to be
migrated in your current 2.x code.

No need to upgrade to 3.0 now to find out, what's still using Fibers.

There is also an article, which covers this packages functionality:
https://dev.to/jankapunkt/prepare-your-meteorjs-project-for-the-big-30-release-24l8

## Installation

```shell
$ meteor add jkuetser:migration-helper
```

Now open in your Meteor.js project the file `.meteor/packages`
and move the entry `jkuester:migration-helper` to the top, in order
to also detect dependency packages that still use Fibers.

## Run detection

This is a runtime detection. In order to cover all detectable 
structures you need to either run your Meteor.js application
or the tests.

The more your tests cover of your code (test-coverage),
the better you will be able to detect these.

## Detect validated methods using mixins

This package also provides a mixin to be used
with `mdg:validated-method` 

You can import it via

```js
import { checkAsyncMixin } from 'meteor/jkuester:migration-helper'

// ...
const m = new ValidatedMethod({
  name: 'coolMethod',
  mixins: [checkAsyncMixin],
  validate: () => {},
  run: () => {}
})
```

A more versatile approach is to use a factory function for your ValidatedMethods:

```js
export const createMethod = options => {
  options.mixins = options.mixins ?? []
  options.mixins.push(checkAsyncMixin)
  return new ValidatedMethod(options)
}
```

If this is not feasible then you might skip this and let the package detect
them at runtime, when they are executed.

## Note

This package may not detect everything. However, it helps
to identify lots of parts on the server that need change and I hope
it will be useful to you.
